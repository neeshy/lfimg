This project is loosely based on https://github.com/cirala/lfimg

With the fork at https://github.com/neeshy/lf
  * previews don't stick around upon the selection changing
  * previews are properly regenerated even if the file has been selected in the
    past
A preview cache (located in ~/.cache/lf) has also been added
